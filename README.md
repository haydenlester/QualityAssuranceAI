# QualityAssuranceAI
Artificial Intelligence, agents used competitively in classes.

Disclaimer: If you use these to assist you with a class, I am not liable. I have omitted the university and class from being mentioned for this reason.
By some chance you stumble across it, these aren't for you, they're for my portfolio.

I can put up my code--It's on you to write and use your own and be academically transparent.

You can use this code for guidance, but if you do, make sure to credit appropriately (or that is also academic dishonesty).
No copy paste tho. Ty.

Only the QualityAssurance agents are my own code. The rest of the code is provided by the instructor to test the agents, and was not altered in any way.
